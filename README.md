## Book Recommendations

https://a2-cmcourville.glitch.me/

- This webpage was inspired by the fact that I love to read yet do not have to time to do so. The website accepts book recommendations by a user inputting the book's title and the book's author.
- A challenge I faced with this application was figuring out in what way I wanted to/ was able to display all the data in the server’s memory  
- To solve this problem, I added a navigation bar at the top of the window which allows you to view the entire “Library”
- This implementation addressed the problem in a practical as well as an asthetically pleasing way.
- An area for future work on this assignment, would be to add a "delete" function to be able to delete different entries that have either been added twice or that someone wishes to remove.
